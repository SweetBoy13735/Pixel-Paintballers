This is my first computer game ever developed; an arcade-style, horde shoot-'em-up.

***NOTE:** For now, this is a re-write of the now-archived "legacy builds", which can be found [here](https://HyperByteIndustries.GitHub.io/Pixel-Paintballers-Legacy). Once this project reaches parity with the most recent build, they will be deleted.*

## Support
If you encounter any problems, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/SweetBoy13735/Pixel-Paintballers/issues) or [E-Mail me](mailto:RamoneGraham@gmail.com) (Provided it hasn't been logged already).

## Roadmap
This portfolio uses the [Git Flow](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--hFtoPgwf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/wo935eqxtakkfylqzn7y.png) branching method to keep track of progress.

I don't have a set time-frame for any releases at the moment, but when I deem it's time, you'll be able to see a [milestone](https://github.com/SweetBoy13735/Pixel-Paintballers/milestones) for it.

## [Contributing](https://github.com/SweetBoy13735/Pixel-Paintballers/blob/Main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
Since it's my own game, I'll be doing most of the heavy-lifting myself. However, I'm open to small contributions. Please check out the link above for more info.
